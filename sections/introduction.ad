== Introduction ==

Writing a project\'s build script is serious business. And so it is when using Ant. Ant does not provide you with any abstraction how the project needs to be build. There is no underlying logic. In fact all what Ant provides are a lot of small work units, calls tasks, that need to be glued together to implement the desired logic. Ant is therefore quite similar to writing a Shell script where you can utilize all those fine masterpieces like `cp`, `mkdir` and `find`. However, Ant lacks any decent control structures. There is no `if-then-else` and there is no `while` footnote:[`if` and `while` can be implemented in terms of calling targets depending on whether a property exists or not. Rather awkward ..]. What\'s more, you have to use a rather unfriendly, sometimes even hostile XML syntax. On the bright side however, consider this Ant snippet:

-------------------------------
<copy todir="${destdir}">
 <fileset dir="${srcdir}">
   <include name="*.jar" />
 </fileset>
</copy>
-------------------------------

It\'s its expressiveness which makes me list this example on the bright side as it is easy to grasp what will happen: files ending in `.jar` are copied from one folder into another folder. Now assume that you have to include some further logic in that snippet above: 

* _if a certain folder exists, copy files matching `*.zip`, otherwise stick with `*.jar`._

When staying with Ant, you define a property and use it like 

-------------------------------
<include name="${jar_or_zip}"/>
-------------------------------

The problem is that you have to define that property elsewhere thus you start to miss part of the logic. This is where I believe that Ant has a true deficit and this is where Flaka kicks in. Flaka provides, amongst other things, with an expression language (EL). Thus you could write

-------------------------------
<include name=" *.#{ mydir.exists ? 'zip' : 'jar'} " />
-------------------------------

However, even having such a powerful extension like EL I am missing the full power of a programming language\'s control structures. Yes, I want to have conditionals, repetitive constructs and a decent exception handling. Furthermore, I want to have variables which I can set or remove for pleasure. I don\'t want to be restricted that such variables may carry strings only. Any data object must be allowed. In summary, this is what Flaka currently is all about:

* Expression Language
* Well known control structures 

This pillars are Flakas approach to simplify the process of writing a build script with Ant. You are by no means forced to use all or any of those pillars. You can for example just use the control structure tasks with or without making use of EL or vice versa.

=== Where to go from here? ===

 * Download footnote:[See http://code.google.com/p/flaka/downloads/list] Flaka and read the <<installation,installation page>>.
 * Make sure to consult chapter <<el,EL, The Expression Language>>. It contains a lot of information on this enormous useful extension.
 * Have a closer look in the reference part of this manual for all the gory details.
 * Start writing build scripts using Flaka and give feedback footnote:[flaka@haefelinger.it].


=== Conventions ===

Ant build file examples show a mix of tasks provided by Flaka and by Ant. Ant task do not require a namespace while those provided by Flaka do. Flaka\'s namespace is 

-----------------------------
antlib:it.haefelinger.flaka
-----------------------------

and within this manual, the abbreviation `c` will be used for this namespace. Therefore it becomes easy to see who is the provider of a task:

-----------------------------
<echo> Ant </echo>
<c:echo> Flaka </c:echo>
-----------------------------

Thus all build file snippets shown assume that the build file contains the following XML namespace declaration:

-----------------------------
<project xmlns:c="antlib:it.haefelinger.flaka" ..>
  <!-- build script example -->
</project>
-----------------------------
