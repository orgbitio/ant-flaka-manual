A small handy task to create a kind of _framed_ text like

-------------------------------------
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::             Text                ::
::          more text              ::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
-------------------------------------

This kind of _logo_ is easily created and dumped on standard output stream like

-------------------------------------
<c:logo chr="::" width="20">
  ;; here is my text
  Text
  more text
</c:logo>
-------------------------------------

where `chr` defines the _wrap character_ - here `::` and `width` defines the overall length of one line - here 20 characters.

==== Attributes ====

[cols="15%,15%,15%,55%"]
|==========================
| Attributes | Type    | Default  | Description 
| chr        | string  | `:`      | The wrapping character ..
| width      | integer | `80`     | Width of one line in terms of regular characters.
|==========================

==== Elements ====

This task accepts an implicit text field. This text field may contain comments (`;`) and leading whitespace is ignored. Thus the same rules as for task <<task_echo>> are applying here.

==== Behaviour ====

Contents of text element is read line by line. Comment lines are ignored. Leading whitespace is ignored. Leading whitespace is determined by the first non-whitespace character. See also task <<task_echo>> for details.

The contents of each line is centered. Leading and trailing space is filled up with _blanks__ in order to reach the given line width. If a line is longer than `width`, then all contents after `width` characters is silently skipped.
